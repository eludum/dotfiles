# dotfiles

install fedora

either use i3 or gnome

## for i3:

the conf files and scripts that are needed are in this repo, move them over to the correct place, I'm assuming future me knows where this is.

## for gnome use this list of extensions:

Terminal:

install fish

https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish

omf install boxfish

https://github.com/PatrickF1/fzf.fish

run these commands for i3 like workspace switching on gnome

Enable a static number of workspaces (e.g. 5 or 10):

```
gsettings set org.gnome.mutter dynamic-workspaces false
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences num-workspaces 5
```

Then unbind all the GNOME default keybindings for switching between applications:

```
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings switch-to-application-1  []
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings switch-to-application-2  []
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings switch-to-application-3  []
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings switch-to-application-4  []
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings switch-to-application-5  []
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings switch-to-application-6  []
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings switch-to-application-7  []
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings switch-to-application-8  []
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings switch-to-application-9  []
```

Rebind them to switch between workspaces on Win + number:

```
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-1  "['<Super>1']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-2  "['<Super>2']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-3  "['<Super>3']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-4  "['<Super>4']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-5  "['<Super>5']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-6  "['<Super>6']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-7  "['<Super>7']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-8  "['<Super>8']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-9  "['<Super>9']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-10 "['<Super>0']"
```  
  
In addition, it's convenient to have Win + Shift + number move a window between workspaces:

```
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-workspace-1  "['<Super><Shift>1']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-workspace-2  "['<Super><Shift>2']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-workspace-3  "['<Super><Shift>3']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-workspace-4  "['<Super><Shift>4']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-workspace-5  "['<Super><Shift>5']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-workspace-6  "['<Super><Shift>6']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-workspace-7  "['<Super><Shift>7']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-workspace-8  "['<Super><Shift>8']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-workspace-9  "['<Super><Shift>9']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-workspace-10 "['<Super><Shift>0']"
```
